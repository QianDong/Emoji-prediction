# Emoji-prediction

We will use the English part of the data from a recent research competition, SemEval 2018 Task 2 on Multilingual emoji prediction.
The task is train massive text which ends with an emoji. Test: give a sentence without emoji, and predict the emoji which likely to appear in the end of this sentence.
